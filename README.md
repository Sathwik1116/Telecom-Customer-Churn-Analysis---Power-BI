# Telco Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI)

##  Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry.  
This project analyzes customer churn patterns using Power BI to identify key drivers of churn and assess their revenue impact.

The analysis focuses on customer demographics, service usage, contract types, billing behavior, and churn concentration.

##  Objectives
- Identify customer segments with high churn risk
- Analyze the impact of tenure, contracts, and services on churn
- Quantify revenue loss due to customer churn
- Provide data-driven insights to support retention strategies
